# Kube-Bench: CIS Benchmark Assessment Tool for Kubernetes
- Kube-Bench is an open-source tool developed by **Aqua Security** that checks if the Kubernetes cluster complies with **CIS Benchmarks**.

## Key Features
- Performs automated security checks for both master and worker node components.
- Shows pass/fail results for each configuration recommendation.
- Helps identify security misconfigurations quickly.

## Deployment Options
We can run Kube-Bench using several methods:
1. Docker Container:
    - Run Kube-Bench in isolation using Docker.
2. Kubernetes Job:
    - Deploy inside the cluster for periodic checks.
3. Binary or From Source:
   - Install the tool directly on a master node or compile for customized usage.

## Step-by-Step Process
1. Identify the Stable Version
    - Visit the Kube-Bench GitHub repo
    - Select a release version that matches your Kubernetes cluster version
2. Install on Master Node
    - Download and install the tool on one of the master nodes (or use Docker/K8s job as preferred)
3. Run the Security Assessment
    - Execute kube-bench to start the CIS Benchmark evaluation
4. Review the Results
    - Analyze the pass/fail report generated for each CIS recommendation
    - Identify potential security misconfigurations
5. Remediate Issues
    - Apply recommended fixes from the report
    - Re-run the assessment to verify compliance
